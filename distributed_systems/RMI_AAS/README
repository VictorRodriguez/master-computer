Introduction
------------

The Java Remote Method Invocation (Java RMI) is a Java API that performs the
object-oriented equivalent of remote procedure calls (RPC), with support for
direct transfer of serialized Java classes and distributed garbage collection.

This practice will:

        1) Create a complete client/server example that uses RMI's unique
        capabilities to load and to execute user-defined tasks at runtime.

        2) The server in the example implements a generic compute engine, which 
        the client uses to compute the value of the pi symbol.

        3) User will run as many clients as he want ( MAX 1000 ) with the
        presition he wants

        4) Plot time -> presition -> number of clients to find a point where is
        a bad idea to increase more the number of clients


Requirements
------------

    -> JDK
    -> Linux base OS ( if you want to make your life easier )


Compilation
-----------

In order to create all the .class

    # make

In order to clean all the .class

    # clean

if you still don't belive your life is easier with a Linux base OS, well in
order to build you just need to:

    # cd <directory> javac *.java

Execution
-----------

[Terminal 1]    # rmiregistry
[Terminal 2]    # java Server 10 2 ( 10 = size of array / 2 = number of clients to start )


TODO
---------------
        MOST IMPORTANT ) Change from quick sort to merge sort :) 
        1) Split array in number of clients 
        2) Send small array to clients 
        3) Gather arrays in one and send it to merge
