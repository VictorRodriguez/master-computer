Introduction
------------

Distributed computing is a field of computer science that studies distributed
systems. A distributed system is a software system in which components located
on networked computers communicate and coordinate their actions by passing
messages. The components interact with each other in order to achieve a
common goal. Three significant characteristics of distributed systems are:
concurrency of components, lack of a global clock, and independent failure of
components. Examples of distributed systems vary from SOA-based systems to
massively multiplayer online games to peer-to-peer applications.


Requirements
------------

    -> JDK 
    -> Linux base OS ( if you want to make your life easier )


Compilation
-----------

In order to create all the .class 

    # make

In order to clean all the .class

    # clean

if you still don't belive your life is easier with a Linux base OS, well in
order to build you just need to: 

    # cd <directory> javac *.java

Execution
