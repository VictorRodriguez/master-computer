    This patch add the first part of the homework to find the min of the Ackley
    Function. The way to run it in an optimal way is:

        python basic_ga.py --population 60 --iterations 40000


    For the Evolutionary strategy the command is as follows: 

        python es.py --min -30 --max 30 -n 30 -g 1000

    This will generate a data.dat file with the generation,value. In order to plot
    it we provide the ploter:

        python file_plot.py

    Is necesary to install extralibraries as numpy and matplotlib.pyplot
