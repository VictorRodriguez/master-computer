Hi

This is a simple readme for the scripts I have to clone and build an entire OS
yea Iknow it sounds hard but it isn't: 

YOu just need to specify the url of the gits you have to clone ( already on the
os_build.sh 

Then yuu need to specify the bundle you want: 

./os_build.sh <bundlefile>

Be carefull and clean the bundle files, check that the file correspond with the
name of the git repo of not.. you will download all the repos :)
